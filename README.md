# Site Health Tool Manager

Depending on your server setup, there may be tests in the WordPress Site Health tool that are not relevant and will never pass. For example, you may have background updates disabled if your entire site is kept under version control.

This plugin adds a simple settings page to exclude those tests from the Site Health Status page.

**Note:** This should *only* be used to disable tests with a legitimate and acceptable reason for failing. *It should not be used to hide tests which can be fixed.*
